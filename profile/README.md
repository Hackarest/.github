# Hackarest

**Hackarest** is a programming club dedicated to high school students in Romania, fiscally sponsored by [The Hack Foundation](https://hackclub.com/sponsor/), a US-based nonprofit (501(c)(3), EIN 81-2908499).

Hackarest is more than just a club—it's a community where code comes to life. Run by high schoolers, for high schoolers, Hackarest is part of the global [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) network, but with its own unique, creative, and practical style. Here, you learn, build, and find your team for your next big project. All you need is curiosity and the drive to start.

- **No formalities, no "musts", no limits.**
- **Focus on real projects, community, and skill-building.**
- **Events like YSWS (You Ship, We Ship):** Build something real (a website, app, game, or hardware project) and get rewarded—no contests, just initiative and the courage to finish what you start.
